# TrackTrack

The next level of tracking nutrition.

### To Do:

- For Yesterday, show the user's profile on that day, not the current day's profile.
- Add favourites dropdown box in Add Meal, when selected input that data but don't save. 
- Add bodyweight option in lbs & kg
- Sort homepage view.
- Add mailers.
- Add stripe integration via a separate controller (priced at Â£5/month), and give 30 day free trial via tracking the signup date (current_user.created_at) and checking to see if it's been longer than 30 days. If so, simply show/redirect to the payment link. 
- Add Help and Diet pages.
- Add domain via DNSimple
- Add Typekit
- Upgrade to two Heroku dynos.
