# TrackTrack

The next level of tracking nutrition.

## To Do:

#### Short Term:

- Add favourites dropdown box in Add Meal, when selected input that data but don't save.
- Sort homepage view.
- Add Help and Diet pages.
- Add Keyboard shortcuts popup.
- ~~Add bodyweight option in lbs & kg~~

#### Medium Term:

- Add domain via DNSimple.
- Add Typekit.
- Upgrade to two Heroku dynos.
- Add mailers.
- Add stripe integration via a separate controller (priced at Â£5/month), and give 30 day free trial via tracking the signup date (current_user.created_at) and checking to see if it's been longer than 30 days. If so, simply show/redirect to the payment link. 

#### Long Term:

- For Yesterday, show the user's profile on that day, not the current day's profile.
- Add calendar to look back at previous days, not just yesterday.
